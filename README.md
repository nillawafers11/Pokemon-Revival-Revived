# Pokémon Silver: Revived
A corroded copy of Pokemon Silver saved from death.

Disclaimer: This is a guide on how to fix a copy of Pokémon Silver that has corroded pins. It will not cover details in depth, but rather a general overview to guide you on how to fix a copy of Pokémon for the Gameboy that has pins that are too far corroded to fix. It is intended for people with beginner/intermediate soldering skills.

I came across a copy of Pokémon Silver that was in rough shape on Facebook Marketplace for $10. It was in really rough shape based on the pictures, and seeing that I had recently taken on soldering as a hobby, I thought to myself, "I can fix it". So I met with the guy, bought it, and immediately I could tell it hadn't been cared for properly. Sticky to the touch, smelled of cigarette. I was really hoping some isopropyl alcohol would do the trick and I could call it a day. That, unfortunately, wasn't the case.
